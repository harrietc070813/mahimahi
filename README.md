mahimahi: a web performance measurement toolkit

# Introduction
Two jitter attack modules have been added to this repo: `mm-bbr-attack` and `mm-copa-attack`. Both modules are designed and implemented based on the first attack model. For details of attack models, see [Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yn0OXKkXK3xg5d5hW8VVk_5SNbBZjEPgKadHVjYpUo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wb3iy6yyoz31). Specifically, `mm-bbr-attack` executes jitter-based attack targeting BBR, while `mm-copa-attack` targets Copa.

# Usage
